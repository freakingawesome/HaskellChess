HChess
======

Learning Haskell by writing a chess simulator.

The board will allow for any number of teams and any size of rectangular board. Currently, the tests are focused on standard chess, so any greater number of teams will probably be buggy.

All standard moves are now accounted for, as well as Castling, Promotion, and En Passant. The notion of a turn-based Game was recently added, which also checks for games ending in stalemate or checkmate.

Eventually this will have a console UI so you can see possible moves and eventually play a game. Looking farther ahead, I want to program some opponents that play using different strategies.
